Imagine you get a call from your bank, and the customer care executive informs you that your card is about to expire in a week. 
Immediately, you check your card details and realise that it will expire in the next 8 days.
Now, in order to renew your membership, the executive asks you to verify a few details such as your credit card number, the expiry date and the CVV number. 
Will you share these details with the executive?
Banks need to be cautious about their customers’ transactions, as they cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters.
Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions if it is reported within a certain time frame by the customer.
The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.
